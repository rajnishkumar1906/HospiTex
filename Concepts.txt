AuthContext.jsx - React Context to hold user info and auth functions (login, logout, check user type)

RequireAuth.jsx — A component wrapper that protects routes, redirects unauthorized or unauthenticated users

Login.jsx — Login page (can have separate login forms for patient and doctor or a combined one)

Register.jsx — Registration page if you allow signups

authService.js — Functions to simulate backend login/auth logic (for now, hardcoded users or mock API)




| File              | Purpose                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AuthContext.jsx` | Hold user state, expose `login()`, `logout()`, and current user info             |
| `RequireAuth.jsx` | Protect routes: if user not logged in or wrong role, redirect to login/dashboard |
| `Login.jsx`       | Show login form, call `login()` from context to set user state                   |
| `Register.jsx`    | Optional, show signup form                                                       |
| `authService.js`  | Mock or real API calls for login and user validation                             |


How the flow will look
=> User visits site

=> If user is not logged in → redirected to login page
 
=> User submits login form → login() updates user info in context
 
=> Based on user role (patient or doctor), redirect to respective dashboard
 
=> RequireAuth protects dashboard routes; users cannot access pages unauthorized for their role
 
=> Navbar and pages render based on user role (your existing code already handles this nicely)
