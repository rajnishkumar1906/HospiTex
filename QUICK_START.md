# 🚀 HospiTex Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Issues Fixed

Your login and signup were failing due to **4 critical errors** - all have been **FIXED**:

1. ✅ Frontend not sending cookies (axios configuration)
2. ✅ Broken server npm script
3. ✅ Incomplete CORS configuration
4. ⚠️ Missing .env file (YOU NEED TO CREATE THIS)

---

## 🔥 Get Running in 5 Minutes

### 1️⃣ Create .env File (REQUIRED)

**Location:** `HospiTex-Server\.env`

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
cd F:\HospiTex\HospiTex-Server
# Create a file named .env (no .txt extension)
```

**Copy this into your .env file:**
```env


**Important:**
- Change `JWT_SECRET` to something random and long
- If you don't have Gmail app password yet, that's OK - auth will still work, emails just won't send

---

### 2️⃣ Start MongoDB

**Option A - If MongoDB is installed as service (Windows):**
```powershell
net start MongoDB
```

**Option B - Manual start:**
```powershell
mongod
```

**Option C - Don't have MongoDB?**
- Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
- Or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud): https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas

---

### 3️⃣ Start Backend Server

```powershell
cd F:\HospiTex\HospiTex-Server
npm run server
```

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Server running at http://localhost:5000
MongoDB Connected: localhost
```

**If you see errors:**
- `JWT_SECRET is undefined` → Create .env file
- `MongoDB connection error` → Start MongoDB
- `Port 5000 is in use` → Kill other process or change PORT in .env

---

### 4️⃣ Start Frontend

**Open a NEW terminal:**
```powershell
cd F:\HospiTex\HospiTex-Ui
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
VITE ready in XXX ms
Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

---

### 5️⃣ Test It! 🎉

1. Open browser: **http://localhost:5173/login**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** tab
3. Fill in:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Password: "password123"
   - Type: "Patient"
4. Click **"Create Account"**
5. You should be redirected to Patient Dashboard ✅

**Try logging out and back in to verify everything works!**

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Network Error" in browser
➡️ Backend not running → Start server (step 3)

### "CORS policy error"
➡️ Frontend not on port 5173 or 5174 → Check port in terminal

### "JWT_SECRET is undefined"
➡️ Missing .env file → Create it (step 1)

### "MongoDB connection error"
➡️ MongoDB not running → Start it (step 2)

### Login works but no email received
➡️ SMTP not configured → That's OK! Auth still works, emails are optional

### Page refreshes and loses login
➡️ Cookies not working → This should be fixed now, clear browser cache

## 🎯 What Was Fixed?

### Before:
```javascript
// ❌ Frontend couldn't receive cookies
axios.post('/auth/login', data)

// ❌ Broken server script
"nodemon run server.js"

// ❌ Missing CORS headers
cors({ origin, credentials: true })
```

### After:
```javascript
// ✅ Frontend properly configured
axios.create({ withCredentials: true })

// ✅ Correct server script
"nodemon server.js"

// ✅ Complete CORS setup
cors({ origin, credentials, methods, headers })
```

## ✨ You're All Set!

Once you create the `.env` file, your login and signup will work perfectly. The fixes ensure:

- ✅ Cookies properly sent between frontend and backend
- ✅ JWT authentication working correctly
- ✅ User sessions persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Secure httpOnly cookie implementation
- ✅ Proper role-based routing (Patient/Doctor/Diagnostic)
