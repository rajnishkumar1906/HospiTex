=== DOCTOR SERVICES AND CONSULTATIONS ===

Doctor Dashboard:
Doctors have access to a comprehensive dashboard showing all their appointments, patient records, and pending consultations. The dashboard displays upcoming appointments, patient history, and allows doctors to manage their schedule.

Appointment Management:
Doctors can view all appointment requests, confirm or reschedule appointments, and mark appointments as completed. When confirming, doctors can add notes about preparation requirements or special instructions for patients.

Patient Records Access:
Doctors can access complete patient medical records including past consultations, diagnostic reports, prescriptions, and medical history. This helps provide informed care and continuity of treatment.

Prescription Management:
After consultations, doctors can create and issue prescriptions. Prescriptions include medication details, dosage, duration, and special instructions. These are automatically saved to patient records.

Consultation Notes:
Doctors document consultation details including symptoms, diagnosis, treatment plan, and recommendations. These notes are part of the patient's medical record and can be reviewed in future consultations.

Patient Communication:
Doctors can send messages to patients through the system, including appointment confirmations, follow-up reminders, test result notifications, and general health advice.

Diagnostic Recommendations:
Doctors can recommend diagnostic tests based on patient conditions. These recommendations are sent to diagnostic centers, and patients receive notifications to schedule the tests.

Follow-up Scheduling:
Doctors can schedule follow-up appointments directly from the consultation interface. Patients receive automatic notifications about scheduled follow-ups.

Emergency Consultations:
For urgent cases, doctors can prioritize appointments and provide immediate consultation. Emergency cases are flagged in the system for quick attention.

Multi-doctor Consultations:
For complex cases, doctors can request consultations with other specialists. The system facilitates coordination between multiple doctors for comprehensive patient care.

Availability Management:
Doctors can set their availability, working hours, and days off. The system automatically updates appointment slots based on doctor availability.

Patient Status Updates:
Doctors can update patient status, mark patients as requiring immediate attention, or flag cases for review by other specialists.
